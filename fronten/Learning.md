// props are used ot pass data from parent components to child components
// in props only parent to child send the data

// props are read only

//App.jsx
// students.jsx
// users.jsx
// teacher .jsx

//state is a built-in react object used to store data that can chnage over time . when the state changes , react automatically updates the user interface(ui)
// hooks is a special react function that lets function components use react features sucha as : useState, useEffect , useContext, useMemo etc
// const [value,setVlaue]=usestate(0)
///
///class App extends React.Component{

////}/////

// props vs state
//props vs state
//props are data passed from a parent to child component | state is data that is managed within a component when state changes, the component re-renders
// props are immutable -- it can not be changed by the child || state are mutable - it can change over time
// does not trigger re-render by itslef || state updates may trigger re-render of the component
// used for passing data from paretn to child components || used of local data that change in the component

/// why do we use hooks
// 1 useState and othes many React features able to used in functional components
// 2 simpler code
// 3 re-useful logic
// 4 easier testing

/// 1 useState in React

//const[count,setCount]=useState(0)
// it is a React Hook that lets us to add state state to functional component it returns a state variable and a function to update that state

// how its works
// initailize the state useState() 0
//update the state using the setState/setCount() 1
// components re-renders with new state 1

/// useEffect

it is a react hook that let us perform side effects in functional components
types of the useeffect  
 1//not dependencies array runs after every render (mounted and updated)
useEffect(()={

});
2// empty dependencies array [] runs only once after the component is mounted
// useEffect()=>{

},[];

3 with dependencies array[deps] runs when the specified dependencies changes

// usecases of the useEffect

1 fetching data from apis
2 updating the document title or meta data
3 controllig timers (settimeout/setinterval())

// Component Lifecycle
Birth-life-Death
Mount(create)-update-Hide(Removed)
it is the series of the stage that a react component goes through from the time it is created until it is removed from the screen.
1 Mounting
Mounting is when a component is created and displayed on the screen for the first time
example
function App(){
return
(
<h1> hello React</h1>
)
}

2 updating
it is the phase updating happens whenever state changes , props change and context changes

3 unmounting
it means the component is removed from the screeen

// Api fetching
What is API?

//useContext
it hepls to share data between components without passing props manually through every level or components (avoids "props drilling")

App(usrname="Rahul")
Navbar()
Menu()
Profiel()

with contenxt
App----> Context ------> Any components
Any component can access the shared data directly

step 1 create user context
step 2 create provider for avalibale the data inside
step 3 creating consumer to consume the data

//useMemo
//useRef

App()----Navbar()----Menu()-----prof()

/// using fetch api

// event handling
it is the process of the responding the user actions sucha as clicking a button, typing in an input field, hovering over an element , or submitting a form

user action click(button) ---- function executes(handleClick()) ----- ui updates( button has been clicked!)

// forms
it is used to collect information form users
//login page
// signup page
//contactus page

flow of react form
user types (rahul) --- onChange()-- updates state (usestate("))-- input value cahnages --- ui updates
//controlled componensts
A controlled components is an input element whose value is controlled by react state
why controlled components?
-- easy validation
-- easy form submission
-- real time updates
-- better data management

//// react-router-dom

it is a library that enables client side routing in react applications.

it allows user to navigate between pages without relaoding the entire browser pages.

npm insall react-router-dom

/// createBrowserRouter
It is a function provided by React router dom that creates a router object by defining all applications routes in one place

old method
<BrowserRouter>
<Routes>// <App />
<Route     >

new method syntax
const router= createBrowserRouter([

])

features of createBrowserRouter

- cleaner
  -- more scalable (update,delete)
  -- better for large applications
  -- supports loaders and actions
